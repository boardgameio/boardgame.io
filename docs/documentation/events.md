# Events

An event is used to advance the game state. It is somewhat
analogous to a move, except that while a move changes
`G`, an event changes `ctx`. Also, events are provided by the
framework (as opposed to moves, which are written by you).

### Event Types

#### endStage

This event takes the player that called it out of the stage
that they are in. If the definition for the current stage
in the game object specifies a `next` option, then the player
is taken to the next stage. If not, the player is
returned to a state where they are not in any stage.

```js
endStage();
```

#### endTurn

This event ends the turn.
The default behavior is to increment `ctx.turn` by `1`
and advance `currentPlayer` to the next player according
to the configured [turn order](turn-order.md) (the default being a round-robin).

This event also accepts an argument, which (if provided)
switches the turn to the specified player instead.

```js
endTurn(); // without argument
endTurn({ next: '2' }); // Player 2 is the next player.
```

#### endPhase

This event ends the current phase. If the definition for the
current phase in the game object specifies a
`next` option, then the game moves to that phase. If not, the
game returns to a state where no phase is active.

```js
endPhase();
```

#### endGame

This event ends the game. If you pass an argument to it,
then that argument is made available in `ctx.gameover`.
After the game is over, further state changes to the game
(via a move or event) are not possible.

```js
endGame();
```

#### setStage

Takes the player that called the event into the stage specified.

```js
setStage('stage-name');
```

#### setPhase

Takes the game into the phase specified. Ends the active phase first.

```js
setPhase('phase-name');
```

#### setActivePlayers

Allows adding additional players to the set of "active players", and
also any stages that you want to put them in. See the guide on [Stages](stages.md)
for more details.

### Triggering an event from game logic.

You can trigger events from a move or code inside
your game logic (a phaseâ€™s `onBegin` hook, for example).
This is done through the `ctx.events` object:

```js
moves: {
  drawCard: (G, ctx) => {
    ctx.events.endPhase();
  };
}
```

!> Events are queued up and triggered **after** a move.
Any changes you make to `G` will be applied before events are
triggered, even if the event is called first in your move function.

### Triggering an event from the client

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Plain JS**

Events are available inside the `events` property of
a boardgame.io client instance. For example:

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';

const client = Client({ /* options */ });

const clickHandler = () => {
  client.events.endTurn();
}
```

#### **React**

Events are available through `props` inside the
`events` object. For example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class Board extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    events: PropTypes.any.isRequired,
  };

  onClick = () => {
    this.props.events.endTurn();
  };

  render = () => <button onClick={this.onClick}>End Turn</button>;
}
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

### Disabling events

Events can be disabled. For example, you might not want a
player to be able to end the game directly by simply calling
the `endGame` event.

In order to disable an event, just add `eventName: false` to
the `events` section in your game config.

```js
const game = {
  events: {
    endGame: false,
    // ...
  },
};
```

!> This doesn't apply to events in moves or hooks, but just the
ability to call an event directly from a client.
