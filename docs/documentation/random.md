# Randomness

Many games allow moves whose outcome depends on shuffled cards or rolled dice.
Take e.g. the game [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee).
A player rolls dice, chooses some, rolls another time, chooses some more, and does a final dice roll.
Depending on the face-up sides the player now must choose where they will score.

This poses interesting challenges regarding the implementation.

- **AI**. Randomness makes games interesting since you cannot predict the future, but it
  needs to be controlled in order for allowing games that can be replayed exactly (e.g. for AI purposes).

- **PRNG State**. The game runs on both the server and client.
  All code and data on the client can be viewed and used to a player's advantage.
  If a client could predict the next random numbers that are to be generated, the future flow of a game stops being unpredictable.
  The library must not allow such a scenario. The RNG and its state must stay at the server.

- **Pure Functions**. The library is built using Redux. This is important for games since each move is a [reducer](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html),
  and thus must be pure. Calling `Math.random()` and other functions that
  maintain external state would make the game logic impure and not idempotent.

### Using Randomness in Games

```js
{
  moves: {
    rollDie: (G, ctx) => {
      G.dieRoll = ctx.random.D6();
    },
  },
}
```

?> The PRNG state is maintained inside `ctx._random` by the `Random`
package automatically.

### Seed

The library uses a `seed` in `ctx._random` that is stripped before it
is sent to the client. All the code that needs randomness uses this
`seed` to generate random numbers.

You can override the initial `seed` like this:

```js
const game = {
  seed: <somevalue>
  ...
};
```

## API Reference

### 1. Die

#### Arguments

1. `spotvalue` (_number_): The die dimension (_default: 6_).
2. `diceCount` (_number_): The number of dice to throw.

#### Returns

The die roll value (or an array of values if `diceCount` is greater than `1`).

#### Usage

```js
const game = Game({
  moves: {
    move(G, ctx) {
      const die = ctx.random.Die(6);      // die = 1-6
      const dice = ctx.random.Die(6, 3);  // dice = [1-6, 1-6, 1-6]
      ...
    },
  }
});
```

### 2. Number

Returns a random number between `0` and `1`.

#### Usage

```js
const game = Game({
  moves: {
    move(G, ctx) {
      const n = ctx.random.Number();
      ...
    },
  }
});
```

### 3. Shuffle

#### Arguments

1. `deck` (_array_): An array to shuffle.

#### Returns

The shuffled array.

#### Usage

```js
const game = Game({
  moves: {
    move(G, ctx) {
      G.deck = ctx.random.Shuffle(G.deck);
    },
  },
});
```

### 4. Wrappers

`D4`, `D6`, `D8`, `D10`, `D12` and `D20` are wrappers around
`Die(n)`.

#### Arguments

1. `diceCount` (_number_): The number of dice to throw.

#### Usage

```js
const game = Game({
  moves: {
    move(G, ctx) {
      const die = ctx.random.D6();
      ...
    },
  }
});
```
