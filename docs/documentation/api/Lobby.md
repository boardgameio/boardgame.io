# Lobby

### React components

You can use the lobby component with the code below:

```js
import { Lobby } from 'boardgame.io/react';

<Lobby
  gameServer={`https://${window.location.hostname}:8000`}
  lobbyServer={`https://${window.location.hostname}:8000`}
  gameComponents={importedGames}
/>;
```

`importedGames` is an array of objects with these fields:

- `game`: The boardgame.io `Game` definition.
- `board`: The React component that will render the board.

### Server-side API

The [Server](/api/Server) hosts the Lobby REST API that can be used to create and join matches. It is particularly useful when you want to
authenticate clients to prove that they have the right to send
actions on behalf of a player.

Authenticated games are created with server-side tokens for each player. You can create a match with the `create` API call, and join a player to a match with the `join` API call.

A game that is authenticated will not accept moves from a client on behalf of a player without the appropriate credential token.

Use the `create` API call to create a match that requires credential tokens. When you call the `join` API, you can retrieve the credential token for a particular player.

#### Configuration

You can pass `lobbyConfig` to configure the Lobby API
during server startup:

```js
server.run({ port: 8000, lobbyConfig });
```

Options are:

- `apiPort`: If specified, it runs the Lobby API in a separate Koa server on this port. Otherwise, it shares the same Koa server runnning on the default boardgame.io `port`.
- `apiCallback`: Called when the Koa server is ready. Only applicable if `apiPort` is specified.
