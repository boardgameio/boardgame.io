# Debugging

### Using the Debug Panel in production

boardgame.io comes bundled with a debug panel that lets you
interact with your game and game clients. When you build your app
for production (i.e. when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`) this is stripped
out from the final bundle.

If you want to include the debug panel in a production build you can
do so explicitly when creating your client:

```js
import { Debug } from 'boardgame.io/debug';

const client = Client({
  // ...
  debug: { impl: Debug },
});
```

### Debug Panel options

You can use the `collapseOnLoad` option to hide the panel by default when the client loads. The `hideToggleButton` option removes the toggle button on the side of the panel which means you can only use the keyboard shortcut to toggle its visibility.

```js
const client = Client({
  // ...
  debug: {
    // ...
    collapseOnLoad: true/false,
    hideToggleButton: true/false
  },
});
```

### Custom metadata in game logs

It can sometimes be helpful to surface some metadata during a move.
You can do this by using the log plugin. For example,

```js
const move = ({ log }) => {
  log.setMetadata('metadata for this move');
};
```

This metadata is stored in the `log` client property and displayed
in the Log section of the debug panel.

### Redux

The framework uses Redux under the hood.
You may sometimes want to debug this Redux store directly.
In order to do so, you can pass along a Redux store enhancer
with your client. For example,

```js
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: applyMiddleware(logger),
});
```

Doing so will `console.log` on state changes. This can also hook into the [Chrome Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/) browser extension like this:

```js
Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: (
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__
    && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
  ),
})
```

or both

```js
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import { applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';

Client({
  // ...
  enhancer: compose(
    applyMiddleware(logger),
    (window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__())
  ),
})
```

### Server + Sockets

The Koa-server can be debugged by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable before starting it.
This will give you access to logs of incoming requests as well as the socket.io logs.
To set the environment variable prepend your npm script to run the server like so:

```
DEBUG=* node server.js
```

> NOTE: For various debugging scopes have a look at the [socket.io-docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/logging-and-debugging/#available-debugging-scopes)
