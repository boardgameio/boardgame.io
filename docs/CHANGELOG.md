## v0.28.0

We now support an alternative style for moves that allows modifying `G` directly.
The old style is still supported.

#### Features

* [[6bdfb11](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/6bdfb11)] add immer

#### Breaking Changes

`undefined` is no longer used to indicate invalid moves. Use the new `INVALID_MOVE`
constant to accomplish this.

```js
import { INVALID_MOVE } from 'boardgame.io/core';

const TicTacToe = Game({
  moves: {
    clickCell: (G, ctx, id) => {
      if (G.cells[id] !== null) {
        return INVALID_MOVE;
      }
      G.cells[id] = ctx.currentPlayer;
    },
  },
});
```

## v0.27.1

#### Features

* [[2d02558](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/2d02558)] add TurnOrder.CUSTOM and TurnOrder.CUSTOM_FROM

#### Bugfixes

* [[8699350](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/8699350)] Prohibit second log event during Update (#303)

## v0.27.0

This is a pretty exciting release with lots of goodies but
with some breaking changes, so make sure to read the section
at the end with tips on migration. The main theme in this
release is the reworking of Phases and Turn Orders to support
more complex game types and other common patterns like the
ability to quickly pop into a phase and back.

#### Features

* [[b7abc57](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/b7abc57)] more turn orders
* [[5fb663a](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/5fb663a)] allow calling setActionPlayers via TurnOrder objects
* [[53473ef](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/53473ef)] change semantics of enabling/disabling events
* [[992416a](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/992416a)] change format of args to endPhase and endTurn
* [[0568857](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/0568857)] change phases syntax

#### Bugfixes

* [[96def53](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/96def53)] add MONGO_DATABASE env variable (#290)

#### Breaking Changes

1. The syntax for phases has changed:

```
// old
phases: [
{ name: 'A', ...opts },
{ name: 'B', ...opts },
]

// new
phases: {
'A': { ...opts },
'B': { ...opts },
}
```

2. There is no implicit ordering of phases. You can specify an
   explicit order via `next` (optional). Note that this allows you to create
   more complex graphs of phases compared to the previous linear
   approach.

```
phases: {
'A': { next: 'B' },
'B': { next: 'A' },
}
```

Take a look at [phases.md](phases.md) to see how `endPhase`
determines which phase to move to.

3. A phase called `default` is always created. This is the phase
   that the game begins in. This is also the phase that the
   game reverts to in case it detects an infinite loop of
   `endPhase` events caused by a cycle.

You can have the game start in a phase different from `default`
using `startingPhase`:

```
flow: {
startingPhase: 'A',
phases: {
A: {},
B: {},
}
}
```

4. The format of the argument to `endPhase` or the return
   value of `endPhaseIf` is now an object of type `{ next: 'phase name' }`

```
// old
endPhase('new phase')
endPhaseIf: () => 'new phase'

// new
endPhase({ next: 'new phase' })
endPhaseIf: () => ({ next: 'new phase' })
```

5. The format of the argument to `endTurn` or the return
   value of `endTurnIf` is now an object of type `{ next: playerID }`

```
// old
endTurn(playerID)
endTurnIf: () => playerID

// new
endTurn({ next: playerID })
endTurnIf: () => ({ next: playerID })
```

6. The semantics of enabling / disabling events has changed
   a bit: see https://boardgame.io/#/events for more details.

7. TurnOrder objects now support `setActionPlayers` args.
   Instead of returning `actionPlayers` in `first` / `next`,
   add an `actionPlayers` section instead.

```
// old
{
first: (G, ctx) => {
playOrderPos: 0,
actionPlayers: [...ctx.playOrder],
}

next: (G, ctx) => {
playOrderPos: ctx.playOrderPos + 1,
actionPlayers: [...ctx.playOrder],
},
}

// new
{
first: (G, ctx) => 0,
next: (G, ctx) => ctx.playOrderPos + 1,
actionPlayers: { all: true },
}
```

* [[acb9d8c](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/acb9d8c)] enable events API in initial onTurnBegin/onPhaseBegin

#### Breaking Changes

* `changeActionPlayers` is now `setActionPlayers`. It also supports more advanced [options](http://boardgame.io/#/events?id=setactionplayers).
* Returning `undefined` from a `TurnOrder` results in the phase ending, not setting `currentPlayer` to `any`.
* Only the `currentPlayer` can call events (`endTurn`, `endPhase` etc.).

#### Breaking Changes

* The `Random` API is different. There is no longer a `Random` package
  that you need to import. The API is attached to the `ctx` parameter that
  is passed to the moves. Take a look at http://boardgame.io/#/random for
  more details.

  * [[003fe46](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/003fe46)] MongoDB connector

#### Breaking Changes

* `boardgame.io/server` no longer has a default export, but returns
  `Server` and `Mongo`.

```
// v0.19
const Server = require('boardgame.io/server').Server;
```

```
// v0.18
const Server = require('boardgame.io/server');
```

## v0.18.1

#### Bugfixes

#### Features

calls from:

```
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client'
```

to:

```
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/react'
```

`boardgame.io/client` exposes a raw JS client that isn't tied
to any particular UI framework.

Buggy fix (fixed in 0.16.7).

#### Features

* [[2721ad4](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/commit/2721ad4)] Allow overriding `db` implementation in Server.

## v0.16.5

#### Features

* `PlayerView.STRIP_SECRETS`

## v0.16.4

#### Bugfixes

* `endPhaseIf` is called after each move (in addition to at the end of a turn).
* `gameID` is namespaced on the server so that there are no clashes across game types.

#### Breaking Changes

* `props.game` is now `props.events` (to avoid confusing it with the `game` object).

```
// OLD
onClick() {
this.props.game.endTurn();
}

// NEW
onClick() {
this.props.events.endTurn();
}
```

## v0.16.3

#### Features

* Multiple game types per server!

#### Breaking Changes

* `Server` now accepts an array `games`, and no longer takes `game` and `numPlayers`.

```
const app = Server({
games: [ TicTacToe, Chess ]
};
```

## v0.16.2

#### Bugfixes

# v0.16.0

#### Features

* [Phases](http://boardgame.io/#/phases)

#### Breaking Changes

* `boardgame.io/game` is now `boardgame.io/core`, and does not have a default export.
* `boardgame.io/client` no longer has a default export.

```
// v0.16
import { Game } from 'boardgame.io/core'
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client'
```

```
// v0.15
import Game from 'boardgame.io/game'
import Client from 'boardgame.io/client'
```

* `victory` is now `endGameIf`, and goes inside a `flow` section.
* The semantics of `endGameIf` are subtly different. The game ends if
  the function returns anything at all.
* `ctx.winner` is now `ctx.gameover`, and contains the return value of `endGameIf`.
* `props.endTurn` is now `props.game.endTurn`.

```

```

```

```
