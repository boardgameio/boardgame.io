# Phases

Most games beyond very simple ones tend to have different
behaviors at various "phases". A game might have a phase
at the beginning where players are drafting cards before
playing, for example. Alternatively, an individual player's turn
might be divided into different phases (an action phase followed by
a buy phase in Dominion, for example).

Each phase in `boardgame.io` defines a set of options
that are applied during that phase. This includes the
ability to restrict moves, use a specific turn order and much more.

#### Card Game

Let us start with a contrived example of a single player
game that has exactly two moves:

* draw a card from the deck into your hand
* play a card from your hand onto the deck

```js
const game = Game({
  setup: () => ({ deck: 5, hand: 0 }),

  moves: {
    drawCard: G => {
      G.deck--;
      G.hand++;
    },
    playCard: G => {
      G.deck++;
      G.hand--;
    },
  },
});
```

We'll ignore the rendering component of this game, but this is how it might look:

```react
<iframe class='react' src='react/phases-1.html' height='800' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

!> Note that you can draw or play a card at any time, including taking a card when the deck is empty.

#### Phases

Now let's say we want the game to work in two phases:

* a first phase where the player can only draw cards (until the deck is empty).
* a second phase where the player can only play cards (until their hand is empty).

In order to do this, we add a `flow` section to the game
spec (you should already be familiar with this as the location
where you placed `endGameIf` in the
[tutorial](#/tutorial?id=add-victory-condition)). It can also contain a `phases` object, which defines different phases in the game. Each phase can specify a list of `allowedMoves`,
which allows only those moves to be played during that phase.

```js
const game = Game({
  setup: () => ({ deck: 5, hand: 0 }),

  moves: {
    drawCard: G => {
      G.deck--;
      G.hand++;
    },
    playCard: G => {
      G.deck++;
      G.hand--;
    },
  },

  flow: {
    startingPhase: 'draw',

    phases: {
      draw: {
        allowedMoves: ['drawCard'],
        endPhaseIf: G => G.deck <= 0,
        next: 'play',
      },

      play: {
        allowedMoves: ['playCard'],
        endPhaseIf: G => G.hand <= 0,
        next: 'draw',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

!> Every game also has an implicit `default` phase, which is just
a phase with no specific options, so the example above actually
has three phases, even though we never use the `default` phase.

### Terminating a phase

A phase ends when one of the following happens:

###### `endPhaseIf` triggers:

This is a function that terminates the phase when it returns a truthy value (see the example above).

###### The `endPhase` event is dispatched:

This can happen either in the game logic or from the client
directly. See the [Events API](events.md) for more details
on how to dispatch events.

### What happens when a phase terminates?

The game moves to the previous phase it was in (at the beginning
of the game this is the `default` phase). This behavior can be
overriden by the following:

1. If a phase specifies the `next` option (like our example above does), then that is chosen as the next phase.

```js
phases: {
  A: {
    next: 'B';
  }
}
```

2. The `endPhase` event accepts an argument that can specify the
   next phase:

```
endPhase({ next: 'B' });
```

3. `endPhaseIf` can return an object specifying the next phase:

```js
endPhaseIf: () => ({ next: 'B' });
```

Watch our game in action now with phases. Notice that you can only draw cards in the first
phase, and you can only play cards in the second phase.

```react
<iframe class='react' src='react/phases-2.html' height='1000' scrolling='no' title='example' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

!> Note the additional fields in `ctx` like `phase`.

#### Automatic Setup and Cleanup

Phases can also specify automatic "board actions" that occur at the beginning or
end of a phase. These are specified just like normal moves in `onPhaseBegin` and
`onPhaseEnd`.

```js
phases: {
  phaseA: {
    onPhaseBegin: (G, ctx) => G,
    onPhaseEnd: (G, ctx) => G,
  },
};
```

#### Triggers / Hooks

The `flow` section can specify a number of automatic behaviors when a move is made
or when the turn or phase is ended. These can also be overridden at the phase level.
Let's take a look at some of these:

!> For an authoritative set of options, take a look
[here](https://github.com/nicolodavis/boardgame.io/blob/master/src/core/flow.js#L139).

```js
flow: {
  // Ends the turn if this returns a truthy value.
  endTurnIf: (G, ctx) => boolean|object

  // Ends the game if this returns anything other than undefined.
  endGameIf: (G, ctx) => {}

  // Run at the start of a turn.
  onTurnBegin: (G, ctx) => G

  // Run at the end of a turn.
  onTurnEnd: (G, ctx) => G

  // Run at the end of a move.
  onMove: (G, ctx) => G

  phases: {
    A: {
      // Ends the phase if this returns a truthy value.
      endPhaseIf: (G, ctx) => boolean|object

      // Run at the beginning of a phase.
      onPhaseBegin: (G, ctx) => G

      // Run at the end of a phase.
      onPhaseEnd:   (G, ctx) => G

      // Can override the global-options here for this
      // specific phase only.
      endTurnIf: ...
      endGameIf: ...
      onTurnBegin: ...
      onTurnEnd: ...
      onMove:    ...
    }
  }
}
```

!> An important point to note is that in a multiplayer game, all of the code under
`flow` is executed only on the master. The code under `moves`, on the other hand, is
run on both client and server. It is run on the client in order to effect a
quick state transition without network lag, and run on the server to process
the authoritative version of the state.
