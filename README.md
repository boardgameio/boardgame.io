<p align="center">
  <strong>boardgame.io</strong> is an engine for creating turn-based games using JavaScript.
</p>

Write simple functions that describe how the game state changes
when a particular move is made. This is automatically converted
into a playable game complete with online multiplayer
features, all without requiring you to write a single line of
networking or storage code.

### Features

- **State Management**: Game state is managed seamlessly across clients, server and storage automatically.
- **Multiplayer**: Game state is kept in sync in realtime and across platforms.
- **AI**: Automatically generated bots that can play your game.
- **Game Phases**: with different game rules and turn orders per phase.
- **Lobby**: Player matchmaking and game creation.
- **Prototyping**: Interface to simulate moves even before you render the game.
- **Extendable**: Plugin system that allows creating new abstractions.
- **View-layer Agnostic**: Use the vanilla JS client or the bindings for React / React Native.
- **Logs**: Game logs with the ability to time travel (viewing the board at an earlier state).
