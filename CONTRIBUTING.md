# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few guidelines that you need to follow.

## Pull Requests

We use GitHub pull requests for external contributions. Code must be well-tested
and not decrease the testing coverage significantly.

The following command must pass for a Pull Request to be considered:

```
$ npm test
```

You can check the test coverage by running:

```
$ npm run test:coverage
```

## Issue tracker

Please use the Issue Tracker to discuss potential improvements you want to make
before sending a Pull Request. It's probably a good idea to hold off on features
before v1.0 is released (bug fixes are ok).

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
