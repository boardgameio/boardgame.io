# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

We use [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for external contributions. Code must be well-tested and not decrease the test coverage significantly.

The following commands must pass for a Pull Request to be considered:

```
$ npm test
$ npm run lint
```

You can also check the test coverage by running:

```
$ npm run test:coverage
```

Please commit your changes to a separate branch so that we can
work together making changes to it before it is ready to be merged.

## Issue tracker

Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/boardgame.io/issues) to discuss potential improvements you want to make
before sending a Pull Request for larger changes.

The Issue Tracker may also contain items labelled **help wanted** or **good first issue**
from time to time. This is a good place to look if you want to contribute but aren't sure where to start.

You may also take on any issues that don't currently have an
assignee (ask on the Issue thread and we'll assign it to you!).

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
